Hi! I'm Seungwoo Han, a graduate student in Management Engineering at KAIST. I am currently focused on two research areas.
First, I examine how consumers process and respond to multimodal content in digital platforms, specifically analyzing how visual and textual information shapes consumer decisions and satisfaction.
Second, I investigate AI adoption in organizations, particularly how implementation affects both operational efficiency and equity in high-stakes public sector contexts.

I have published work on AI implementation in police departments and multimodal consumer behavior analysis, with papers accepted at ICIS 2025 and CIST 2024. My research leverages computational methods and publicly accessible datasets to address questions of both operational efficiency and social equity in technology adoption. Methodologically, I am interested in causal inference, machine learning, and multimodal analysis.

My interest in Information Systems grew from observing how technology mediates decisions in everyday life. As a consumer, I rely on algorithmically curated information that shapes my choices in ways I cannot fully see or verify. This curiosity deepened when I recognized that similar systems operate in high-stakes organizational contexts where they affect not just efficiency but also fairness and equity across communities. I find it compelling to study how information technologies influence outcomes in settings where algorithmic decisions have real consequences for both individuals and society.

I completed my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering and computer science at KAIST, and served as an English interpreter and translator in the Republic of Korea Air Force. I am currently applying to Ph.D. programs in Information Systems.
