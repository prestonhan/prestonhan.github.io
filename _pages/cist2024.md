## <span class="section-title">Abstract</span>

<p class="abstract-text">
The combined effect of customer-generated images (CGIs) and firm-generated images (FGIs) on post-purchase satisfaction, as well as the integration of CGIs with customer review text and FGIs with product descriptions, remains insufficiently explored in existing research. This study postulates that the similarity between CGIs and FGIs influences subsequent product ratings through expectation disconfirmation, the number of helpful votes through confirmation needs, and sentiment analysis of reviews through cognitive dissonance reduction. Using a difference-in-differences model, we find that high similarity between user-generated content (CGI and customer review set) and firm-generated content (FGI and firm-generated description) increases subsequent ratings and helpful votes. However, the similarity results in declining subsequent sentiment scores, a counterintuitive outcome given the common assumption that higher ratings are usually associated with more positive sentiment. While conventional feature extraction methods fail to capture the complex interplay of image and text, this study employs a multimodal model to measure the similarity between CGI and FGI, effectively capturing the complex representation of both modalities. This approach significantly enhances the comprehensiveness of online review analysis. Prior literature consistently indicates that customer-generated images (CGIs) negatively impact post-ratings. Our findings align with this, further revealing that CGI-FGI similarity exerts a nuanced effect on consumer behavior, underscoring the importance of multimodal content in online reviews. Additionally, our results offer valuable insights for designing effective e-commerce review policies and optimizing product images and descriptions for firm sellers.
