This chapter examines the ongoing dispute between the Korean government and medical community over expanding medical school admissions from 3,058 to 5,058 students annually. While the government emphasizes physician shortages based on OECD comparisons and regional healthcare gaps, the medical community argues that uneven distribution rather than absolute numbers is the core issue, warning about potential quality degradation.
The analysis applies prospect theory to explain how both sides exhibit loss aversion, status quo bias, and anchoring effects rooted in different reference points. The government anchors on OECD statistics and views inaction as a significant loss, while the medical community anchors on current educational infrastructure and perceives expansion as threatening medical quality.
Through game theory, the conflict resembles a chicken game rather than a prisoner's dilemma. Both parties expect the other to concede first, maintaining hardline positions that risk mutual loss. This strategic standoff, combined with confirmation bias on both sides, creates a self-reinforcing cycle of distrust.
The chapter proposes solutions including establishing shared reference points, transparent information exchange, neutral evaluation bodies, credible signaling mechanisms, and phased implementation with clear incentive structures to facilitate cooperative equilibrium.
